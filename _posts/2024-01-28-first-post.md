# Here it is!

I'm going to start doing more writing (I think). This is just the beginning. In the past I've written a couple of articles on projects I've carried out, and I have found that it's a great way to cement the new things I might have learnt, while also offering a chance to evaluate the work and perhaps redress my ego which is often disproportionately inflated after completing something vaguely cool.

I'd like to start for realsies with a nod to my first project writeup about my home central heating system, which was my first proper python project, and which I still use (although now in its third version it bears very little resemblance to the version the article talks about, as at the time I was obviously a complete novice, floating along under the overinflated ego previously mentioned; the code is a steaming pile of shit basically). Perhaps a good "proper" first article would be to look at what I've learnt since then, and what I would do differently. Stay tuned! For now though:

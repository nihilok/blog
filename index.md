title: Nihilok's log!
---

Hi, I'm `nihilok`, I'm a full-stack software developer, and I'm going to start pushing my 2 cents on GitHub. The only way I ever write is if there's an element of programming involved, which is why I'm starting a GitHub pages blog, as it seems the easiest and yet still somewhat "programmatic" way to be blogging! (I've already got bored with hosting my own blog front-end/back-end; or should I say, I don't need that level of distraction when there are so many other things to do!?)
